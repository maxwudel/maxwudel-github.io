    "section": "",
    "text": "With the NBA playoffs officially underway, let’s take a look at the team that finished at the top of the rankings, the Milwaukee Bucks. To cap off the 2020-2021 season, the Bucks ended their 50 year championship drought when they defeated the Phoenix Suns in six games. Giannis Antetokounmpo won Finals MVP and Milwaukee became a city of champions. Last year, the Bucks met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Semifinals and were eliminated after the Celtics won game 7 in Boston.\nNow its 2023 and Milwaukee finished with the best record in the NBA at 58-24 and secured the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference. They are slated to match up with the Miami Heat in the first round, the same team they played in the first round during their championship run two years ago. Their path to the finals wont be any easier this year as the Eastern Conference powerhouses wont go down without a fight. The Celtics finished just one game behind the Bucks and are considered favorites to win it all by many.\nWhat separates this years Milwaukee team from last years? The first and most important factor for Milwaukee has been the return of big man Brook Lopez. Back surgery limited Lopez to just 13 games last season and his return has spearheaded Milwaukee’s defensive rise. Lopez finished this regular season as the league leader in blocks and has elevated his ability to defend outside of the paint. Joe Ingles, an off-season addition, has begun to prove his worth in Milwaukee as well. Ingles had been sidelined for a year following an ACL tear in January 2022 but the Australian native has hit hit groove. Heading into the playoffs, Lopez and Ingles are leading Milwaukee in True Shooting Percentage. True Shooting Percentage is a metric that takes into account efficiency of all shots, including free throws. Lets take a look at Milwaukee and how their shooting compares to the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nadvanced <- read_csv(\"data/23Advanced.csv\") %>%\n  filter(MP > 800) %>%\n  mutate(Pos = factor(Pos,levels=c(\"C\",\"PF\",\"SF\",\"SG\",\"PG\")))\neastaverages <- read_csv(\"data/TeamAverages.csv\") %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Milwaukee\"| Team == \"Boston\"| Team == \"Philadelphia\"| Team == \"New York\"| Team == \"Cleveland\"| Team == \"Miami\"| Team == \"Brooklyn\"| Team == \"Atlanta\"| Team == \"Chicago\"| Team == \"Toronto\")\nratings <- read_csv(\"data/TeamRatings.csv\")\n\nbucks <- advanced %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"MIL\")\n\nstarters <- bucks %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Brook Lopez\" | Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\" | Player == \"Jrue Holiday\" | Player == \"Khris Middleton\" | Player == \"Grayson Allen\" | Player == \"Joe Ingles\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=advanced,\n     groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=`TS%`), \n    color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bucks,\n     groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=`TS%`), \n    color=\"#00471B\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=starters, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=`TS%`, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Position\", \n    y=\"True Shooting %\", \n    title=\"Joe Ingles hitting his groove in first season with Milwaukee\", \n    subtitle=\"Ingles and Lopez missed last season with injuries.

Grayson Allen has molded into a starting role without the presence of Khris Middleton for most of the regular season. Middleton suffered a wrist injury in the first round of the 2021-2022 playoffs which kept him sidelined for all but 33 games.\nAllen and Ingles both have true shooting percentages over 60% which cements them among the best at their respective positions. With Middleton back in the starting rotation, Allen has moved back to his bench role but continues to shoot well when called on. When buckets become tougher to find in the playoffs, consistent shooting can be the difference between a disappointing exit and a spot in the finals.\nLeading Milwaukee in True Shooting Percentage is Brook Lopez. At 63%, Lopez’s true shooting percentage is average when compared to other centers in the league. Lopez attempted more three pointers than any other center in the league. With his ability to spread the floor its no wonder his TS% doesn’t stand out. Players like Nic Claxton and Rudy Gobert are taking over 70% of their shots within three feet of the rim. While Lopez is the most efficient scorer for Milwaukee, his presence is largely felt on the defensive end. Lets take a look at how Milwaukee’s offensive and defensive production compares to the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\necfratings <- ratings %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Milwaukee Bucks\"| Team == \"Boston Celtics\"| Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\"| Team == \"New York Knicks\"| Team == \"Cleveland Cavaliers\"| Team == \"Miami Heat\"| Team == \"Brooklyn Nets\"| Team == \"Atlanta Hawks\"| Team == \"Chicago Bulls\"| Team == \"Toronto Raptors\") \n\necftop <- ecfratings %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Milwaukee Bucks\"| Team == \"Boston Celtics\"| Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\"| Team == \"Cleveland Cavaliers\")\n\nmilwaukee <- ecftop %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Milwaukee Bucks\")\n\nboston <- ecftop %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Boston Celtics\")\n\nphilly <- ecftop %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\")\n\ncleveland <- ecftop %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Cleveland Cavaliers\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ratings, \n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ecftop,\n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV),\n  color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(\n     data=milwaukee,\n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV),\n  color=\"#00471B\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=boston,\n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV),\n  color=\"#007A33\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=philly,\n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV),\n  color=\"#006BB6\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=cleveland,\n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, size=MOV),\n  color=\"#860038\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 115.6837) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 115.6833) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=ecftop, \n    aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, label=Team),\n    nudge_y = .58\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Brook Lopez solidifies Milwaukee\", \n    subtitle=\"Lopez's return sparked Milwaukee's rise from 14th to 4th in defensive rating\",   \n       caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\",\n       x=\"Offensive Rating\",\n       y=\"Defensive Rating\")  + \n  geom_text(aes(x=112.5, y=118, label=\"Bad Offense, Bad Defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=118, y=110.5, label=\"Great Defense, Great Offense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = \"black\"))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nMilwaukee finished thee 2021-2022 season ranked 14th in defensive rating. Since then, Lopez has returned to the starting lineup and fueled Milwaukee’s rise to fourth overall in team defense. At 34 years old, Lopez led the league in blocks totaling 193 across 78 games. Lopez’s ability to protect the paint allows his fellow teammates Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday to harass opponents in the open court knowing Lopez is there to help.\nWhen Lopez began his tenure in Milwaukee in 2018, he transformed his play style to become a better three point shooter allowing him to stretch the floor offensively. Since his return from back surgery, Lopez has continued to elevate his game by becoming a more well-rounded defender. Lopez no longer solely patrols the paint. He has gained the ability to pick players up near the three-point line and understand where his teammates are to better defend shiftier guards. Lopez’s efforts have earned him a chance to win this years Defensive Player of the Year award as he is one of the three nominees.\nWith Brook Lopez solidifying Milwaukee’s defense and Ingles and Allen leading shooters in efficiency, lets take a look at how the Bucks team offense compares to the rest of the eastern conference playoff teams. To do this I have created a Z-Score. Z-Scores are a statistical measure of the distance from the mean. For this Z-Score I totaled field goal averages, rebounding averages and assist averages while subtracting turnover averages. A team with a score of zero is perfectly average. The larger the positive number gets from zero, the better that teams production is. Let’s take a look at the scores.\n\n\nCode\nteamzscores <- eastaverages %>% \n  mutate(\n    FGZscore = as.numeric(scale(`FG%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    RebZscore = as.numeric(scale(RPG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    AstZscore = as.numeric(scale(APG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TovZscore = as.numeric(scale(TOV, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TotalZscore = FGZscore + RebZscore + AstZscore - TovZscore\n  ) %>% \n  select(Team,FGZscore,RebZscore,AstZscore,TovZscore,TotalZscore)\n\nfinalscores <- teamzscores %>% arrange(desc(TotalZscore)) %>% select(Team,TotalZscore)\n\nfinalscores %>% \n  gt() %>%\n    tab_header(\n    title = \"Boston leads the Eastern Conference in Offensive Output\",\n    subtitle = \"The Celtics are like a microwave.

When compared to Boston, their rating seems exceptionally low but this is because only four bucks played 70 or more games during the regular season. Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer spent much of the regular season testing new lineups and gave star players the rest that they much deserved.\nDespite this, Milwaukee still finished with a score of .67 which is well above the rest of the Eastern Conference playoff teams. The standout here is the Atlanta Hawks. They finish as the seven seed in the eastern conference and have not been in the eyes of those predicting champions. Unfortunately for them, they have to play the Boston Celtics in the first round who hold the score for most exceptional offense in the Eastern Conference.\nDuring Khris Middleton’s absence, Jrue Holiday has adapted a larger role for Milwaukee’s offense and his production has soared because of it. With Middleton returning to the starting lineup, Holiday will be able to focus more on his defensive prowess. The same goes for Bobby Portis. He adapted a starting role last year with Lopez sidelined with a back injury and has since returned to the bench. Portis’s increased production has translated to his role on the bench as he is now one of the three nominees for Sixth Man of the Year.\nMilwaukee’s run to the finals will be nothing short of difficult. Boston, Philadelphia and Cleveland have cemented themselves as powerhouses this season. Boston holds the best offense in the eastern conference and Cleveland boasts the best defense in the NBA. Philadelphia has the MVP front runner in Joel Embiid and a hunger to reach the Eastern Conference Finals.\nTo even make an appearance in the Finals, Milwaukee is going to have to increase the efficiency of their shooting. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton will need be there when Antetokounmpo passes it out to them. Defense has not been the issue for Milwaukee this season as they finished fourth in the league in defensive rating. Milwaukee will have to dominate the board and in transition if they want to win their third total championship."

    "title": "Who are the best centers in the NBA?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Golden State Warriors were up 3-1 on the Cleveland Cavilers during the 2016 NBA Finals. Heading into game 5 they needed just one more win to claim their back-to-back championships. Everything was going perfectly until early on in the second half when their starting center, Andrew Bogut, left for the locker room with an apparent knee injury. He never returned to the series and the Cleveland Cavilers came back to win a historic title. Bogut averaged 4.0 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in the 2016 Finals but his impact went far beyond simple statistics. Standing at an immense seven feet tall, Bogut was the primary setter of screens and played impeccable defense. He was a crucial contributor for the most important aspects of that Golden State team and without him they fell apart.\nNowadays, Centers have become highly under-appreciated in the National Basketball Association. Kids only want to talk about Ja Morant’s dunks or Steph Curry’s three pointers. Nobody seems to pay attention to the big man who rebounds Morant’s miss or sets the perimeter screen for Curry to take an open shot. Centers are just as important to the game of basketball as any other player despite their more “boring” play style.\nOver the last couple of years the Center position has seen new life as players like Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid exert their dominance on the court. They, along with many others, have adapted their play style to better fit today’s game. Centers are no longer restricted to the paint and have more freedom with where they take their shots.This has paved the way for hybrid positions like the Stretch-4 or Stretch-5. As younger talent joins the league, veterans like Brook Lopez and Al Horford have revamped their game to better fit the league’s style.\nRegardless of how the league changes the true nature of the Center position remains true. The big boys have to play defense and command a presence on the court. 3x Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert has done just that. Gobert patrols the paint and only leaves after he blocks a shot into the concessions.\nHow can we determine who the best centers are in the NBA?\nWell lets take a look at some of the numbers.\nWe will only be looking at players who are listed as just a center so players like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Jarren Jackson Junior wont be appearing on this. Giannis is listed as “F” for Freak.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nstats21 <- read_csv(\"nba21stats.csv\") %>% \n  filter(Pos == \"C\", GS > 30)\n\npointleaders <- stats21 %>% \n  filter(PTS > 20)\n\nefgpleaders <- stats21 %>%\n  filter(`eFG%` > .67)\n\nstats21totals <- read_csv(\"stats21nbatotals.csv\") %>%\n  filter(Pos == \"C\", TRB > 650)\n\nrebounds <- stats21totals %>% \n  group_by(Player) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalOffRebounds = sum(ORB),\n    TotalDefRebounds = sum(DRB)) \n  \nrebounds %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Rebounds\") -> reboundsgraph\n\ncto <- read_csv(\"stats21nbatotals.csv\") %>%\n  filter(Pos == \"C\") %>%\n  group_by(Player, Tm, STL, BLK) %>%\n  summarise(CausedTurnovers = sum(STL) + sum(BLK)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(CausedTurnovers)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  top_n(10)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=stats21, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=efgpleaders, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=pointleaders, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_encircle(data=efgpleaders, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), s_shape=0, expand=0.01, colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=26, y=.65, label=\"Leading Scorers\"),size=3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=15, y=.77, label=\"Most Efficient\"),size=3.5) +\n  geom_encircle(data=pointleaders, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), s_shape=0, expand=0.01, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=stats21, aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`), method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=pointleaders, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`, label=Player),size=3.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=efgpleaders, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`eFG%`, label=Player),size=3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Per Game\", \n    y=\"Effective Fielg Goal Percentage\", \n    title=\"Who was the most efficient scorer in 2021?\", \n    subtitle=\"New York's Robinson led all centers in field goal efficinecy while 2x MVP Jokić led the top scorers. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we looking at here? To start, Effective Field Goal Percentage is an adjusted metric for the fact that a 3-pointer is worth more than a 2-pointer. On the right hand side we have a collection of the leading scorers and up top we have a collection of those who were the most efficient scoring the basketball. The leading scorers are in a position where they are commanding a lot of offensive attention. All four of them have specific plays set for them and the near freedom to play how they desire. Leading all centers and the entire league in scoring was Joel Embiid. While Embiid scored in high volume, he did not score as efficiently as Nikola Jokic nor anywhere near as efficient as Mitchell Robinson.\nNow what makes Robinson so efficient? It’s the fact that he isn’t taking very many shots. Robinson averaged just under five attempts a game in his 62 starts. This goes to show that Robinson is a more defensive minded center. He understands that his role is to protect the rim and grab rebounds. Others like Rob Williams and Jarrett Allen are in this same conversation. They are doing the dirty work to help their team win games.\nWe just mentioned rebounds and that might be the most important aspect for the center position. It is pivotal in the game of basketball to have as many possessions as you possibly can and rebounds allow a team to do just that. Offensive rebounds are especially pertinent as they allow you team another attempt at scoring points.\nLets take a look at the top rebounding centers from last year.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=reboundsgraph, \n    aes(x=reorder(Player, Rebounds), \n        weight=Rebounds, \n        fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey18\", \"darkgreen\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Rebounds\", \n    title=\"Steven Adams hoarded offensive rebounds. \", \n    subtitle=\"Adams grabbed over fifty more than the next player but still falls short of the league leaders.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe most impressive part of this graph is Steven Adams. Nearly half of all his rebounds were on the offensive end and no one else comes close to that ratio. Another notable feat comes from Andre Drummond as he primarily came off the bench last season and still managed to finish within the top ten for total rebounds.\nLeading the rebounders is Nikola Jokic and following just behind him is Rudy Gobert. Jokic continues to impress as he gathered over 1100 boards. This shows that not only is Jokic scoring lots of points at a highly efficient rate; he is also also making sure to gobble up every basketball he can find. Clint Capela has made a name for himself solely from rebounding and his place on this list cements that.\nRebounds are to basketball as ground balls are to lacrosse. They are a nitty gritty feature of a contact sport. Once that ball hits the rim its a free for all and who else would you want fighting for that ball than a seven foot tall man.\nThe last statistic we will look at are turnovers. More specifically caused turnovers.\nLets take a look at who forced the most turnovers during last years NBA season.\n\n\nCode\ncto %>% gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    CausedTurnovers = \"Caused Turnovers\",\n    STL = \"Steals\",\n    BLK = \"Blocks\",\n    Tm = \"Team\") %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who forced the most turnovers?\",\n    subtitle = \"Utah's Gobert led the league in blocks while Denver's Jokić led all centers in steals.\")  %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Max Wudel  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html)\")\n  )  %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(4)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"navy\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"UTA\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"yellow\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"DEN\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Who forced the most turnovers?\n    \n    \n      Utah's Gobert led the league in blocks while Denver's Jokić led all centers in steals.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Player\n      Team\n      Steals\n      Blocks\n      Caused Turnovers\n    \n  \n  \n    Mitchell Robinson\nNYK\n58\n133\n191\n    Robert Williams\nBOS\n56\n134\n190\n    Rudy Gobert\nUTA\n45\n137\n182\n    Joel Embiid\nPHI\n77\n99\n176\n    Nikola Jokić\nDEN\n109\n63\n172\n    Jakob Poeltl\nSAS\n45\n118\n163\n    Mo Bamba\nORL\n38\n118\n156\n    Karl-Anthony Towns\nMIN\n72\n83\n155\n    Clint Capela\nATL\n55\n93\n148\n    Andre Drummond\nTOT\n78\n68\n146\n    Myles Turner\nIND\n28\n118\n146\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Max Wudel  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis graph details a players blocks, steals, and forced turnovers (a combination of blocks and steals). Leading all centers in blocks last year was Rudy Gobert and leading all centers in steals was Nikola Jokic. Gobert is an immense defensive presence so it comes with no surprise that he led in blocks. Steals are typically a stat for guards and it is extremely impressive for a big man like him to accumulate such a total. For context, Dejounte Murray led the NBA last season with 138 steals and Jokic finished tenth among the entire league. That is unheard of.\nTopping our list here is a familiar name in Mitchell Robinson. Last year he had the best eFG% among all centers and also led them in forced turnovers. This is rather impressive for a guy you don’t hear a lot of noise about. Robert Williams is another name to think about because his efficiency and points per game is nearly identical to that of Robinson’s and he finished with just one less forced turnover. Robinson, Williams, and Gobert might not get you 25 points a night but they are going to fight to keep the ball out of their net.\nWith everything said and done, who are the best centers in the NBA? Well it depends on what you’re looking for. If your value offensive prowess then Joel Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns might be your option. If you are looking for a rebounding machine you might focus on Clint Capela or Steven Adams for the increased offensive possessions. If you want a defensive specialist then Mitchell Robinson or Robert Williams is your answer.\nBut who are the best.\nThe best offensive center is Joel Embiid as he rebounds at a high level and scores at an even higher one. The best defensive center is Rudy Gobert with his ability to force turnovers and gobble up rebounds. The best overall center is without a doubt Nikola Jokic. Jokic efficiently scores in high volume and led the league in rebounds while also leading all centers in steals and finishing within the top five for forced turnovers. There’s a reason why he won last years MVP trophy."

    "text": "Kirk Cousins is a name that most households would not associate with greatness. Vikings fans would tend to agree. The media loves to show his poor record on Monday Night Football and when his team loses, Cousins is often blamed. No matter what happens, Cousins is somehow on the receiving end of criticism.\nLast year, the Minnesota Vikings finished with a record of 7-9 and 8-9 in the last two seasons. Their defense’s inability to close out games resulted in the firing of their head coach Mike Zimmer and general manager Rick Spielman. Anybody who willingly tormented themselves and watched those games would know that Cousins himself was far from the problem.\nFor the entirety of the Mike Zimmer era, the Vikings were a defensive minded team who managed to get by offensively. The entire NFL turned their heads when they decided to sign Cousins to a 3-year, $84 million deal. This deal signified the first time the team had went out and made a move for a big name ball slinger since Brett Favre. Both the Minnesota Vikings and Kirk Cousins have received their fair amounts of criticism since the deal was made.\nIs all of that criticism deserved?\nLets take a look at some of Cousins’ stats from the 2021 season. First we’ll look at where he stacks up against last seasons passing leaders.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"2021pfrqb.csv\") \nqbs21 <- read_csv(\"2021PFRQB.csv\")\nstats21 <- read_csv(\"2021PFRQB.csv\")\nstats20 <- read_csv(\"2020PFRQB.csv\")\nqbs19 <- read_csv(\"2019PFRQB.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2019)\nqbs18 <- read_csv(\"2018PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2018) \nqbs17 <- read_csv(\"2017PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2017)\nqbs16 <- read_csv(\"2016PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2016)\nqbs15 <- read_csv(\"2015PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2015)\n\nqbs <- stats %>% filter(PassYds > 4000)\n\nkirk <- stats %>% filter(Player ==\"Kirk Cousins\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=qbs, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, PassYds), x=PassYds), \n    horizontal = TRUE\n    ) + \n   geom_lollipop(\n    data=kirk, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, PassYds), x=PassYds), \n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    colour = \"purple\"\n    ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"2021 Passing Yards\", \n    y=\"Quarterback\", \n    title=\"Kirk Cousins was right there with the rest\", \n    subtitle=\"Cousins knows how to air it out and even threw for more yards than the NFL MVP, Aaron Rodgers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNot too shabby for the quarterback of an 8-9 team. Justin Herbert is the only other quarterback on this list who failed to make the playoffs but his Chargers were eliminated in overtime of their last regular season game by Derek Carr.\nCousins finished 9th overall in passing yards and only just below some of the absolute best in the business. Yards are just one piece of the puzzle however. In 2019, Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston threw for 5109 yards and 33 touchdowns. Winston also threw for a league high 30 interceptions.\nWe know that last year Cousins was able to throw the ball better than most the league. Yes he was throwing the ball a lot but how effective was he with those passes? Lets take a look at the touchdowns and interceptions he threw compared to the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\nkirk21 <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player ==\"Kirk Cousins\")\n\noutliers <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player ==\"Matthew Stafford\" | Player ==\"Trevor Lawrence\" | Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\" | Player == \"Daniel Jones\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=qbs21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=kirk21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=outliers, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 23.3872) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 11.22581) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=30, y=10, label=\"More Tds, Less Ints\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=15, y=13, label=\"More Ints, Less Tds\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=kirk21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int, label=Player),size=3.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=outliers, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int, label=Player),size=3.5\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Cousins was among the best when targeting the endzone\", subtitle=\"He was among the best when throwing to the endzone and away from his defenders.\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nWell what do you know. Cousins was among the best in the business last year when producing positive results with the football. According to this chart Cousins was one of the top 6 quarterbacks in the league when throwing the ball and keeping his touchdown/interception ratio as minuscule as possible.\nLet’s take a peek at one more statistic. Total Quarterback Rating< or QBR for short< is ESPN’s measurement for grading a quarterbacks performance. The metric takes into account each and every contribution from a quarterback and weighs them based on the context of the game. This includes passing, rushing, sacks, penalties, touchdowns and turnovers.\nCousins became a starter in 2015 and hasn’t looked back since. Lets take a look at how his QBR has changed since becoming a starter and compare that to other veteran quarterbacks and the leagues’ QBR average.\n\n\n\nCode\nqbs21 <- stats21 %>% mutate(YEAR = 2021)\n\nqbs20 <- stats20 %>% mutate(YEAR = 2020)\n\nallqbs <- (bind_rows(qbs21,qbs20,qbs19,qbs18,qbs17,qbs16,qbs15)) \n\ncousins <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Kirk Cousins\")\nbrady <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Tom Brady\")\nbrees <-  allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Drew Brees\")\nwilson <-  allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\nrodgers <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\")\nfitz <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ryan Fitzpatrick\")\nryan <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Matt Ryan\")\ntannehill <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ryan Tannehill\")\ncarr <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Derek Carr\")\ndalton <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Andy Dalton\")\nben <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ben Roethlisberger\")\nprescott <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Dak Prescott\")\nallyears <- bind_rows(brady, brees,wilson,rodgers,fitz,ryan,tannehill,carr,dalton,ben,prescott)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=cousins, aes(x= YEAR, y=QBR), color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_line(data=allyears, aes(x= YEAR, y=QBR), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 55.67261, color=\"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Player) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"QBR\", \n    title=\"Cousins is elite at staying consistent\", \n    subtitle=\"Since becoming a starter his QBR has hovered around or above the leage average\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see why the elite are named as such. Players like Rodgers, Brady, Brees and Wilson have been premier quarterbacks within the NFL for years and the data represents that. While Cousins’ QBR has been on a downward trend since 2015, he has remained above and around the league’s average.\nKirk Cousins has been an NFL starting quarterback for seven years and in each of those years he has had a new offensive coordinator. While he himself has been a very consistent quarterback, he has not had consistent playbooks and personnel around him.\nAfter firing their head coach and general manager, the Minnesota Vikings have hired head coach Kevin O’Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. The Vikings also signed Cousins to a one-year extension worth $35 million.\nCurrently, the Vikings are 7-1 and sit comfortably atop the NFC North and at second place in the NFC. Cousins is now quarterbacking a team that finds ways to finish games as opposed to losing them. Now that the Vikings are winning games much less has been said about their starting quarterback.\nIf the Vikings make a push this year the public perception of Kirk Cousins might finally change for the better."

    "title": "A Tale of Two Bigs; Giannis Antetokounmpo v. Anthony Davis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "With Milwaukee eliminated from the 2022-23 playoffs, I am once again finding myself at the hands of my dear friends. Friends who unfortunately love to argue and discredit each other over their favorite sports teams and players. I have been at their mercy this entire year because my teams completely fell apart during the playoffs but I must trudge on. An argument I seem to always find myself in revolves around Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo. I believe Giannis clears that argument with his two MVP’s and Finals MVP but to some that just isn’t enough. He still gets called “run and dunk boy” and they just cant see that he is clearly better than Anthony Day-To-Davis.\nIt is entirely possible however, that I am the one spreading misinformation. I have watched significantly less of Anthony Davis’s game and have only ever looked at a couple of his stats. I looked at how he wanted to be traded from New Orleans after multiple playoff exits and how he joined LeBron James in Los Angeles. Davis has always been considered a master of the mid-range and in his years with the Pelicans he was undoubtedly the single most dominant force around the paint. My favorable opinion of Davis has slowly faded as he began to suffer from nagging injuries which kept him off the court. Since the 2018-19 season, Davis has missed 160 out of the 410 possible games he could have played in. His inability to stay healthy resulted in a statistical decline and only served to weaken my opinion of him. During the 2022-23 season Davis has seen a statistical resurgence as he begins to get healthier and his numbers are starting to feel like they’re actually representing Anthony Davis.\nThe first thing were going to take a look at is how their points per game and field goal percentage has changed since they both joined the league. Anthony Davis entered the league in 2012 as the first overall pick in the NBA draft and already blew fans away with his talent. Giannis entered the league as the 15th overall pick in the 2013 draft and was primarily known for his impossible to pronounce last name. As a skinny and underdeveloped 19 year-old, few would have imagined that he would one day be considered as the best player in the NBA. This was just meant to be some light reading so lets take a look at some of the numbers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngianniscareer <- read_csv(\"gianniscareer.csv\")\n\ndaviscareer <- read_csv(\"daviscareer.csv\")\n\nadvanced <- read_csv(\"advancedstats.csv\") \n\npergame <- read_csv(\"pergamestats.csv\")\n\nratings <- read_csv(\"ratings.csv\")\n\nplayoffs <- read_csv(\"playoffs.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    PlayoffRating = ((PTS * `FG%`) + AST + TRB) / ((TOV + PF))\n    ) %>%\n  select(\n    Player,G,PTS,PlayoffRating\n  )%>%\n  arrange(desc(PlayoffRating)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  top_n(10)\n\nline1 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=gianniscareer, aes(x=Season, y=`FG%`, group= Lg), color=\"#00471B\")+\n  geom_line(data =daviscareer, aes(x=Season, y=`FG%`,group= Lg), color=\"#552583\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.40, .60)) +\n  labs(title=\"Anthony Davis reamerges as Giannis continues to grow \", subtitle = \"Davis returns to his old self as he battles through injuries\",  x=\"\", y=\"Field Goal Percentage\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nline2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=gianniscareer, aes(x=Season, y=PTS, group= Lg), color=\"#00471B\") +\n  geom_line(data =daviscareer, aes(x=Season, y=PTS,group= Lg), color=\"#552583\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=8.8, label=\"Anthony Davis\"), color=\"#552583\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=9.5, y=3.5, label=\"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"), color=\"#00471B\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,35)) +\n  labs(title=\"\", \n       subtitle = \"\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\",\n       x=\"Season\", \n       y=\"Points Per Game\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot_grid(line1,line2,ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, Davis has seen a decline in his field goal percentage and his points per game. This is largely due to his inability to stay on the court. As his health has improved these past two seasons, so have his numbers. Davis’s stats have been trending upwards as he set a new career high in field goal percentage this season at 56%. His points per game peaked in 2016 and 2017 and that’s when his New Orleans Pelicans were playing at their best. Injuries aside his points per game has likely decreased due to his new teammate pairing of LeBron James and the supporting cast that the Lakers seem to just pull out of a mystery bag. He simply doesn’t need to carry a failing franchise anymore.\nOn the other end is Giannis Antetokounmpo. He averaged just over six points per game his rookie season and finished the 2022-23 season as one of the minuscule number of players to average over 30 points per game. He was named the 2016-17 Most Improved Player as he made the transition to forward and raised his points per game from 17 to 23. He has continued to work and polish his game as his stats have steadily increased each season. Giannis’s field goal percentage has stagnated as he has shot 53% in three of the last four seasons. While Davis’s numbers have taken a step back over the last couple of years, Giannis’s numbers have matched that of one of the leagues best.\nWith Davis beginning to return to his normal self in the 2022-23 season, lets compare their usage percentage and how it relates to their points per game. We will compare their numbers to other power forwards and centers within the NBA and the data set will not include anyone who played less than 20 regular season games.\n\n\nCode\nadvancedwpts <- merge(advanced,pergame,by=\"Player\") %>%\n  filter(Pos.x == \"PF\"| Pos.x == \"C\")\n\nadvancedfinal <- advancedwpts %>%\n  filter(G.x > 20)\n\ngiannis <- advancedfinal %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\n\ndavis <- advancedfinal %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Anthony Davis\")\n\ntheboys <- advancedfinal %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"| Player == \"Anthony Davis\")\n\nadvancedfinal <- advancedwpts %>%\n  filter(G.x > 20)\n\npct1 <- scales::percent_format(scale = 1)\npct1(100)\n\n\n[1] \"100%\"\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=advancedfinal, aes(x=`USG%`, y=PTS), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=giannis, aes(x=`USG%`, y=PTS), color=\"#00471B\") +\n  geom_point(data=davis, aes(x=`USG%`, y=PTS), color=\"#552583\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=advancedfinal, aes(x=`USG%`, y=PTS), method=\"lm\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1),limits = c(5,40)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=theboys, \n    aes(x=`USG%`, y=PTS, label=Player),size=3.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,35)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Usage Percent\", \n    y=\"Points Per Game\", \n    title=\"Milwaukee runs through Giannis and only Giannis\", \n    subtitle=\"His usage rating led all players and propelled Milwaukee to the leagues best record\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage rating is a metric involving an estimate of the percentage of team plays used by a player while they were on the court. In the 2022-23 regular season, Giannis led all players with a usage rating of 38.8% and finished behind league MVP Joel Embiid in points per game. That meant that on any given possession, there was nearly a 40% chance that Giannis was going to initiate Milwaukee’s offense.\nAnthony Davis finished with a usage rating of 28.4% which is actually the same as his career average. Davis’s usage rating peaked in 2016 at 32.6% but those numbers have stayed rather consistent. Davis finished in the top 10 for both usage rating and points per game when compared to other bigs and it marks his return to dominance.\nContrary to what the media might want you to think, there is far more to basektball than just scoring points. Especcialy when it comes to bigs. They are expected to be a commanding force on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball. Davis is a three time block champion and has been named to the NBA All Defense team four times in his career. Giannis was the 2019-20 Defensive Player of the Year and has been named to the NBA All Defense team five times in his career. Its safe to say that there arent many players that enjoy being defended by either of these players. Lets take a look at how their offensive and defensive ratings reflected their ammount of win shares.\n\n\nCode\nratingsadvanced <- merge(advancedfinal,ratings,by=\"Player\") %>%\n  select(Player,Ortg,Drtg,WS)\n\ntheboys2 <- ratingsadvanced %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"| Player == \"Anthony Davis\"| Player == \"Joel Embiid\")\ngiannis <- theboys2 %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\ndavis <- theboys2 %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Anthony Davis\")\nembiid <- theboys2 %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Joel Embiid\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ratingsadvanced, \n    aes(x=Ortg, y=Drtg, size=WS), \n    color=\"lightgrey\", \n    alpha=.5\n    ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=giannis,\n    aes(x=Ortg, y=Drtg, size=WS),\n  color=\"#00471B\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=davis,\n    aes(x=Ortg, y=Drtg, size=WS),\n  color=\"#552583\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=embiid,\n    aes(x=Ortg, y=Drtg, size=WS),\n  color=\"#006BB6\"\n    ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 119.7348) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 113.3035) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=theboys2, \n    aes(x=Ortg, y=Drtg, label=Player),\n    nudge_y = 1\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Bigger isn't always better, ask a golfer\", \n    subtitle=\"Davis returned to form as he dominated the defensive paint\",   \n       caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\",\n       x=\"Offensive Rating\",\n       y=\"Defensive Rating\")  + \n  geom_text(aes(x=109, y=118, label=\"Bad Offense, Bad Defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=131, y=104, label=\"Great Defense, Great Offense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = \"black\"))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nA win share is a statistic which tries to divvy up team success by giving credit to the individuals on that team. Essentially, it is a combination of how a players offensive and defensive play helps their team to either win or lose. The larger the number the better and the smaller the number becomes… lets just say that you might receive a phone call from the Shanghai Sharks. To put it in perspective, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s total of 25.4 Win Shares in 1971-72 is the all-time single-season record and his 273.4 career Win Shares are the all-time career record.\nJoel Embiid was named the 2022-23 NBA MVP and I included him in this chart as a reference point. He was largely the most dominant player this season so I wanted to see how Giannis and Davis compared. Embiid finished with an offensive rating of 124 which is rather impressive given the workload he faces in Philadelphia. His defensive rating was 109 which slots him between Mitchell Robinson and DPOY runner up Brook Lopez. Embiid was credited with 12.3 win shares and you would expect that from the league MVP.\nGiannis finished with an Ortg of 117 ,Drtg of 107.8, and was credited with 8.6 win shares. I would have expected his Ortg to be higher given his increased usage rating this season but his defensive rating remains elite. He finished in the top five of big men and his win shares are understandable when you consider the elevated role that Jrue Holiday took for Milwaukee this season.\nDavis finished with an Ortg of 124, Drtg of 106.5 and was credited with 9 win shares. His defensive rating of 106.5 is the third best across the league and was certainly crucial for the Lakers to secure a spot in the playoffs. His offensive rating can be contributed to his increased efficiency this season as he saw a massive jump in his field goal percentage. His role as a closer for the Lakers has translated to some impressive stats\nSo far we have only looked at regular season stats so lets look at where it really matters, the Playoffs. Ive created a playoff rating score which tallies up points per game with field goal percentage then adds the players average rebounds and assists. That number is then divided by the combined turnovers and fouls a player averages and results in our playoff rating.

Regardless, his playoff numbers have been impressive and his play helped the Lakers win it all in 2020.\nGiannis rests between two of the greatest to ever do it in Dirk Nowitzki and Tim Duncan. Duncan has the second most games played among this group but never had to face a workload like Giannis did offensively. That’s simply a testament to how great those Spurs teams where.\nPlayoff basketball is a whole new world to dive into and a separate piece would need to be made to fully analyze their playoff prowess. Take this with a grain of salt.\nAfter looking at the stats these two players are far more similar than I had expected them to be. Their numbers are often comparable to one another. Giannis has taken the next step forward and began to leave Davis behind. Now that Davis is getting healthier his stats are beginning to trend towards the elite playstyle of the Anthony Davis we all grew to love in New Orleans. Davis is a master of the mid-range and commands his presence around the rim. Giannis flies around the court and does everything with a full head of steam. It may be impossible to determine who is actually better at the sport of basketball without a match up between them in the playoffs."
