    "title": "Does Kirk Cousins deserve the Criticism?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, the Minnesota Vikings finished with a record of 7-9 and 8-9 in the last two seasons. Their defense’s inability to close out games resulted in the firing of their head coach Mike Zimmer and general manager Rick Spielman. Anybody who willingly tormented themselves and watched those games would know that Cousins himself was far from the problem.\nFor the entirety of the Mike Zimmer era, the Vikings were a defensive minded team who managed to get by offensively. The entire NFL turned their heads when they decided to sign Cousins to a 3-year, $84 million deal. This deal signified the first time the team had went out and made a move for a big name ball slinger since Brett Favre. Both the Minnesota Vikings and Kirk Cousins have received their fair amounts of criticism since the deal was made.\nIs all of that criticism deserved?\nLets take a look at some of Cousins’ stats from the 2021 season. First we’ll look at where he stacks up against last seasons passing leaders.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"2021pfrqb.csv\") \nqbs21 <- read_csv(\"2021PFRQB.csv\")\nstats21 <- read_csv(\"2021PFRQB.csv\")\nstats20 <- read_csv(\"2020PFRQB.csv\")\nqbs19 <- read_csv(\"2019PFRQB.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2019)\nqbs18 <- read_csv(\"2018PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2018) \nqbs17 <- read_csv(\"2017PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2017)\nqbs16 <- read_csv(\"2016PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2016)\nqbs15 <- read_csv(\"2015PFRQB.csv\")  %>%\n  mutate(YEAR = 2015)\n\nqbs <- stats %>% filter(PassYds > 4000)\n\nkirk <- stats %>% filter(Player ==\"Kirk Cousins\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=qbs, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, PassYds), x=PassYds), \n    horizontal = TRUE\n    ) + \n   geom_lollipop(\n    data=kirk, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, PassYds), x=PassYds), \n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    colour = \"purple\"\n    ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Quarterback\", \n    y=\"2021 Passing Yards\", \n    title=\"Kirk Cousins was right there with the rest\", \n    subtitle=\"Cousins knows how to air it out and even threw for more yards than the NFL MVP, Aaron Rodgers\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNot too shabby for the quarterback of an 8-9 team. Justin Herbert is the only other quarterback on this list who failed to make the playoffs but his Chargers were eliminated in overtime of their last regular season game by Derek Carr.\nCousins finished 9th overall in passing yards and only just below some of the absolute best in the business. Yards are just one piece of the puzzle however. In 2019, Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston threw for 5109 yards and 33 touchdowns. Winston also threw for a league high 30 interceptions.\nWe know that last year Cousins was able to throw the ball better than most the league. Yes he was throwing the ball a lot but how effective was he with those passes? Lets take a look at the touchdowns and interceptions he threw compared to the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\nkirk21 <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player ==\"Kirk Cousins\")\n\noutliers <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player ==\"Matthew Stafford\" | Player ==\"Trevor Lawrence\" | Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\" | Player == \"Daniel Jones\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=qbs21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=kirk21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=outliers, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int,size=PassYds), \n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 23.3872) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 11.22581) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=30, y=10, label=\"More Tds, Less Ints\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=15, y=13, label=\"More Ints, Less Tds\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=kirk21, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int, label=Player),size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=outliers, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Int, label=Player),size=3\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Cousins was among the best when targeting the endzone\", subtitle=\"He was among the best when throwing to the endzone and away from his defenders.\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nWell what do you know. Cousins was among the best in the business last year when producing positive results with the football. According to this chart Cousins was one of the top 6 quarterbacks in the league when throwing the ball and keeping his touchdown/interception ratio as minuscule as possible.\nLet’s take a peek at one more statistic. Total Quarterback Rating< or QBR for short< is ESPN’s measurement for grading a quarterbacks performance. The metric takes into account each and every contribution from a quarterback and weighs them based on the context of the game. This includes passing, rushing, sacks, penalties, touchdowns and turnovers.\nCousins became a starter in 2015 and hasn’t looked back since. Lets take a look at how his QBR has changed since becoming a starter and compare that to other veteran quarterbacks and the leagues’ QBR average.\n\n\n\nCode\nqbs21 <- stats21 %>% mutate(YEAR = 2021)\n\nqbs20 <- stats20 %>% mutate(YEAR = 2020)\n\nallqbs <- (bind_rows(qbs21,qbs20,qbs19,qbs18,qbs17,qbs16,qbs15)) \n\ncousins <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Kirk Cousins\")\nbrady <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Tom Brady\")\nbrees <-  allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Drew Brees\")\nwilson <-  allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\nrodgers <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\")\nfitz <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ryan Fitzpatrick\")\nryan <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Matt Ryan\")\ntannehill <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ryan Tannehill\")\ncarr <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Derek Carr\")\ndalton <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Andy Dalton\")\nben <- allqbs %>% filter(Player == \"Ben Roethlisberger\")\nprescott <- allqbs %>% filter(Player ==\"Dak Prescott\")\nallyears <- bind_rows(brady, brees,wilson,rodgers,fitz,ryan,tannehill,carr,dalton,ben,prescott)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=cousins, aes(x= YEAR, y=QBR), color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_line(data=allyears, aes(x= YEAR, y=QBR), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 55.67261, color=\"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Player) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"QBR\", \n    title=\"Cousins is elite at staying consistent\", \n    subtitle=\"Since becoming a starter his QBR has hovered around or above the leage average\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Max Wudel\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see why the elite are named as such. Players like Rodgers, Brady, Brees and Wilson have been premier quarterbacks within the NFL for years and the data represents that. While Cousins’ QBR has been on a downward trend since 2015, he has remained above and around the league’s average.\nKirk Cousins has been an NFL starting quarterback for seven years and in each of those years he has had a new offensive coordinator. While he himself has been a very consistent quarterback, he has not had consistent playbooks and personnel around him.\nAfter firing their head coach and general manager, the Minnesota Vikings have hired head coach Kevin O’Connel and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah"
